                <h3>Smart Garbage Management System Using IOT</h3>
                <p>The Smart waste management system that identifies fullness of the bin using a wireless sensor network (WSN). The system provides a web interface to the cleaning authority so that they can monitor and clean the garbage bin. In this ultra-sonic sensors are used to determine the status of the dust bins. Waste management are the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process. One of the main concerns with our environment has been solid waste management which impacts the health and environment of our society. A large portion of waste management practices deal with municipal solid waste (MSW) which is the bulk of the waste that is created by household, industrial, and commercial activity.</p>
                <p>Technologies Used: Sensors, intelligent monitoring systems, and mobile applications.</p>

                <h3>Distributed Denial of Service Attack and Defense</h3>
                <p>Always-on DDoS mitigation: A DDoS mitigation provider can help prevent DDoS attacks by continuously analyzing network traffic, implementing policy changes in response to emerging attack patterns, and providing an expansive and reliable network of data centers. DDoS attacks work by directing malicious traffic to a target via multiple computers or machines. Often, these machines form a botnet: a group of devices that have been compromised by malware and can be controlled by a single attacker. Other DDoS attacks may involve multiple attackers or DDoS attack tools, such as stress-testing applications (e.g. LOIC) or low-and-slow programs (e.g. Slowloris).</p>
                <p>Technologies Used: Black hole routing, Dropping malicious traffic</p>
